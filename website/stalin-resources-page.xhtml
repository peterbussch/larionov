        <hr />
        <p>This project would not be possible without a few key resources. Since our work is in the
            public domain, we've been able to tinker with the corpus for our digital methods
            purposes. Here is a link to the Russian-language website we employed for the primary
            source material. The following resources have been invaluable for creating historical
            projects using computer methods. Here is a link to our Github repo, where we've done our
            best to plot our progress throughout the semester. This was a new tool for our team, and
            it was nice to start "thinking like a computer" through the process of git pushing and
            pulling. </p>
