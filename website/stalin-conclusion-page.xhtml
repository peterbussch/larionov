            <p>One of the things which marked-up xml documents enable for the end user is a rich set
                of data which can be explored in all manner of ways. Our project has seval goals.
                The first goal is to create a website where enthusiasts can easily engage with the
                corpus of letters between Stalin and Molotov in a readable and intuitive manner. Our
                second goal is to utilize the information derived from our markup of the corpus to
                draw historical conclusions which could augment a traditional investigation of tne
                Stalin era. We made note of the various locations, policies, and people who Stalin
                wrote about in order to obtain statistical information to bolster our historical
                analysis. As the time period of the corresponse rougly corresponds to the tine in
                which Stalin consolidated his power in the Sovet Union, the document corpus is
                illumaniting for the student of Stalinism and Soviet history writ large.</p>

                <br /><br /> It is hard to overstate the vastness of the Soviet Union. Soviet power
                stretched from the temperate Black Sea climate, winding through the Ukrainian region
                into the heart of European Russia, extending itself along the expanse of Asia to
                reach the Pacific Ocean and border Japan. Much before the time of Stalin, Tsars and
                their ministers grappled with the problems of overland empire, forging solutions
                such as the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Many of these projects were successes for
                commerce but became a source of humiliation when the Russians lost territory to
                Japan (an upstart power) in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905.<br /> The role of the
                    <strong>place</strong> in the Stalin-Molotov correspondence is an important one,
                suggestive of priorities in Stalin's view of the USSR and the world around it. We
                see, of course, mentions of cities and regions within the Soviet Union, including
                references to autonomous republics within the federal structure. Especially
                important to Stalin are the regions associated with his primary policy agendas:
                industrial hubs, urban centers, sites of agricultural output. However, it is
                impossible to deny that Stalin had his eyes abroad in many of these letters. This is
                supported by the data which was extracted from the documents.</p>

            <p> Digital methods, particularly the linking of various digital tools at the disposal
                of a modern researcher, enables a whole new world of statistical analytics. There
                are a lot that we as students can gain from employing digital methods in
                conjunction. For example, the example above shows the initial markup of the corpus
                set the stage for our research avenues.</p>

                <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Agency</h2>
                <p>The Soviet Union was dominated by variou agencies of control which sought to
                    regulate a societ aimed towards socialism. Even as Stalin made effective use of
                    the various bureaucracis under his common through vigorous leadership, it is
                    impossible to deny that Soviet agencies, with their lack of constructive
                    communication, retarded the development of the emerging socialist state.
                    However, for a system that exchewed western methods of ascertaining expertise,
                    government agencies become sought-after employment amongst the Sovet citizenry.
                    Especially with the advent of Brezhnev era, with its perks for employees of
                    state agencies, most turned towards working for the state in some capacity</p>

                <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Ideology</h2>
                <p>As a Marxist-Leninst state firmly committed to its ideolody in the face of the
                    "captilist powers" which the USSR believed to their enemies through their
                    interpretation of history, I was expecting to find high levels of ideological
                    discussion within the corresponse of Stalin to Molotov, but there was not as
                    much in that area as I expected. Certainly one encounters the Marxist
                    interpretation of history in explications of what is happening in the West (or
                    the prudence of the collectivation policy) but that is not necessarily the case.
                    What we find in Stalin is an effective adminstrator, one who is concerned with
                    the successful completion of industrialization and an understanding of world
                    politics.</p>

                <p>Within Stalin's letters, as we might expect, we see various references to
                    individuals within the highest echelons of Soviet society as well as to
                    lesser-known figures. Throughout the letters, Stalin comes across as someone who
                    is meticulously up-to-date on what is happening within the Soviet Union. Whether
                    it be a displeasing artlce published in <em>Pravda</em> or holdup in steel
                    production, he is very aware. This hawkish view of the Soviet Union leads Stalin
                    at various times to denouce, publicly or privately, to excoriate members of the
                    Sovet government who are percieved to be doing a poor (worse, corrupt) duty of
                    administraion. </p>

            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Policy</h2>
            <p>In the years leading up to the 1917 Revolution, there were many years of productive
                and economic growth, largely driven through investments of foreign capital as well
                as a liberalizing administration. However, high levels of growth were only
                sustainable until the outbreak of World War I, which sealed the fate of the Romanov
                dynasty. After Nicholas II abdicated, the progressive Provincial Government
                attempted to implement a series of economic liberalizations. Their efforts were
                rendered useless by their continued support for an unpopular war and the rise of
                social movements of all kinds. With that background in place, we move on to the role
                of policy in the USSR. Whether one thinks of collectivization or socially engineered
                salaries, played an integral part in the Soviet system. Stalin, like his predecessor
                Lenin, believed that the key to Soviet independence was the establishment of massive
                industrial power. In tagging "policy" within the document, we had to employ a
                relatively liberal method. For example, mentions of factory construction is tagged
                as policy due to the historical connotations,</p>

            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Publication</h2>
            <p>Publications, as one would likely imagine, were particularly limited in the Soviet
                Union. Discourse on the public stage, to the extent where it did exist, was often
                conducted through official channels or magazines lie <em>Pravda</em> or
                    <em>Komsomolsya</em>. Since publication was so centralized, a commom theme in
                Stalin's letters is discussion of articles in the newspapers which Stalin vehemently
                disagrees with, For example, as time progresses, we see specific instance of
                criticism of Bukharin and Trotsky appear.</p>
