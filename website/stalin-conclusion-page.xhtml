            <p>One of the things which marked-up xml documents enable for the end user is a rich set
                of data which can be explored in all manner of ways. Our project has seval goals.
                The first goal is to create a website where enthusiasts can easily engage with the
                corpus of letters between Stalin and Molotov in a readable and intuitive manner. Our
                second goal is to utilize the information derived from our markup of the corpus to
                draw historical conclusions which could augment a traditional investigation of tne
                Stalin era. We made note of the various locations, policies, and people who Stalin
                wrote about in order to obtain statistical information to bolster our historical
                analysis. As the time period of the corresponse rougly corresponds to the tine in
                which Stalin consolidated his power in the Sovet Union, the document corpus is
                illumaniting for the student of Stalinism and Soviet history writ large.</p>

            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Agency</h2>
            <p>The Soviet Union was dominated by variou agencies of control which sought to regulate
                a societ aimed towards socialism. Even as Stalin made effective use of the various
                bureaucracis under his common through vigorous leadership, it is impossible to deny
                that Soviet agencies, with their lack of constructive communication, retarded the
                development of the emerging socialist state. However, for a system that exchewed
                western methods of ascertaining expertise, government agencies become sought-after
                employment amongst the Sovet citizenry. Especially with the advent of Brezhnev era,
                with its perks for employees of state agencies, most turned towards working for the
                state in some capacity</p>

            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Ideology</h2>
            <p>As a Marxist-Leninst state firmly committed to its ideolody in the face of the
                "captilist powers" which the USSR believed to their enemies through their
                interpretation of history, I was expecting to find high levels of ideological
                discussion within the corresponse of Stalin to Molotov, but there was not as much in
                that area as I expected. Certainly one encounters the Marxist interpretation of
                history in explications of what is happening in the West (or the prudence of the
                collectivation policy) but that is not necessarily the case. What we find in Stalin
                is an effective adminstrator, one who is concerned with the successful completion of
                industrialization and an understanding of world politics.</p>

        <section id="people">

            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Person</h2>
            <p>Within Stalin's letters, as we might expect, we see various references to individuals
                within the highest echelons of Soviet society as well as to lesser-known figures.
                Throughout the letters, Stalin comes across as someone who is meticulously
                up-to-date on what is happening within the Soviet Union. Whether it be a displeasing
                artlce published in <em>Pravda</em> or holdup in steel production, he is very aware.
                This hawkish view of the Soviet Union leads Stalin at various times to denouce,
                publicly or privately, to excoriate members of the Sovet government who are
                percieved to be doing a poor (worse, corrupt) duty of administraion. </p>

        <section id="policy">
            <img src="policy.gif" alt="policy" style="height:300px; width:auto;" />
            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Policy</h2>
            <p>Policies, whether one thinks of collectivization or socially engineered salaries,
                played an integral part in the Soviet system. Stalin, like his predecessor Lenin,
                believed that the key to Soviet independence was the establishment of massive
                industrial power. In tagging "policy" within the document, we had to employ a
                relatively liberal method. For example, mentions of factory construction is tagged
                as policy due to the historical connotations,</p>

        <section id="publication">
            <img src="publication.png" alt="publication" style="height:300px; width:auto;" />
            <h2 style="border:#B22222; border-width:5px; border-style:solid">Publication</h2>
            <p>Publications, as one would likely imagine, were particularly limited in the Soviet
                Union. Discourse on the public stage, to the extent where it did exist, was often
                conducted through official channels or magazines lie <em>Pravda</em> or
                    <em>Komsomolsya</em>. Since publication was so centralized, a commom theme in
                Stalin's letters is discussion of articles in the newspapers which Stalin vehemently
                disagrees with, For example, as time progresses, we see specific instance of
                criticism of Bukharin and Trotsky appear.</p>
