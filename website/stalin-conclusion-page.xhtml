        <h1>Mapping Themes and Characters in Stalin's Letters</h1>
        <p>One of the things which marked-up xml documents enable for the end user is a rich set of
            data which can be explored in all manner of ways. Our project has seval goals. The first
            goal is to create a website where enthusiasts can easily engage with the corpus of
            letters between Stalin and Molotov in a readable and intuitive manner. Our second goal
            is to utilize the information derived from our markup of the corpus to draw historical
            conclusions which could augment a traditional investigation of tne Stalin era. We made
            note of the various locations, policies, and people who Stalin wrote about in order to
            obtain statistical information to bolster our historical analysis. As the time period of
            the corresponse rougly corresponds to the tine in which Stalin consolidated his power in
            the Sovet Union, the document corpus is illumaniting for the student of Stalinism and
            Soviet history writ large.</p>

        <h2>agency</h2>
        <p>The Soviet Union was dominated by variou agencies of control which sought to regulate a
            societ aimed towards socialism. Even as Stalin made effective use of the various
            bureaucracis under his common through vigorous leadership, it is impossible to deny that
            Soviet agencies, with their lack of constructive communication, retarded the development
            of the emerging socialist state. However, for a system that exchewed western methods of
            ascertaining expertise, government agencies become sought-after employment amongst the
            Sovet citizenry. Especially with the advent of Brezhnev era, with its perks for
            employees of state agencies, most turned towards working for the state in some
            capacity</p> 
        <img src="ideology.png" alt="ideology" />
        <h2>Ideology</h2>
        <p>As a Marxist-Leninst state firmly committed to its ideolody in the face of the "captilist
            powers" which the USSR believed to their enemies through their interpretation of
            history, I was expecting to find high levels of ideological discussion within the
            corresponse of Stalin to Molotov, but there was not as much in that area as I expected.
            Certainly one encounters the Marxist interpretation of history in explications of what
            is happening in the West (or the prudence of the collectivation policy) but that is not
            necessarily the case. What we find in Stalin is an effective adminstrator, one who is
            concerned with the successful completion of industrialization and an understanding of
            world politics.</p>
        <img src="people.jpeg" alt="people" />
        <h2>person</h2>
        <p>Within Stalin's letters, as we might expect, we see various references to individuals
            within the highest echelons of Soviet society as well as to lesser-known figures.
            Throughout the letters, Stalin comes across as someone who is meticulously up-to-date on
            what is happening within the Soviet Union. Whether it be a displeasing artlce published
            in <em>Pravda</em> or holdup in steel production, he is very aware. This hawkish view of
            the Soviet Union leads Stalin at various times to denouce, publicly or privately, to
            excoriate members of the Sovet government who are percieved to be doing a poor (worse,
            corrupt) duty of administraion. </p>
        <img src="policy.gif" alt="policy"/>
        <h2>policy</h2>
        <p>Policies, whether one thinks of collectivization or socially engineered salaries, played
            an integral part in the Soviet system. Stalin, like his predecessor Lenin, believed that
            the key to Soviet independence was the establishment of massive industrial power. In
            tagging "policy" within the document, we had to employ a relatively liberal method. For
            example, mentions of factory construction is tagged as policy due to the historical
            connotations,</p>

        <h2>publication</h2>
        <p>Publications, as one would likely imagine, were particularly limited in the Soviet Union.
            Discourse on the public stage, to the extent where it did exist, was often conducted
            through official channels or magazines lie <em>Pravda</em> or <em>Komsomolsya</em>.
            Since publication was so centralized, a commom theme in Stalin's letters is discussion
            of articles in the newspapers which Stalin vehemently disagrees with, For example, as
            time progresses, we see specific instance of criticism of Bukharin and Trotsky
            appear.</p>
