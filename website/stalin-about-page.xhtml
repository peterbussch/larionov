        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This project was created by Hunter Cassoza and Peter Busscher for Computational Methods
            in the Humanities at the University of Pittsburgh. This work explores the correspondence
            between Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov between 1925 and 1936. Our team contains
            two members,one who can lead the Russian language of the Stalin correspondence, and one
            who is primarily focused on the technical ascpects of thie project.</p>
        <h2>Joseph Stalin</h2>

        <p>This project was created by Hunter Cassoza and Peter Busscher for Computational Methods
            in the Humanities at the University of Pittsburgh. This work explores the correspondence
            between Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov between 1925 and 1936. In these letters we
            see a leader who is in many ways empowered, but still ascending his own personal quest
            to power. In these letters we see a wide-ranging subject matter of industrial policy,
            specific articles in Komsomolskaya Pravda and international relations, among other
            things. </p>
        <h2>Vyacheslav Molotov</h2>

        <p>Compared to Joseph Stalin, who needs little introduction, Vyacheslav Molotov may be less
            familiar to a general audience. To students of Soviet history and World War II, Molotov
            is a silent giant. While he was capable of great outbursts of emotion, Molotov was a
            quite, calculating man. He was an extraordinarily effective deputy, and an effective
            negotiator. Famously, he concluded the Pact with Hitler's Germany which has became known
            to history as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Although, within these letters, Molotov was
            not yet the influential Foreign Affairs Minister that he would later become, he is still
            a privileged confidant who learns the inner workings (to the greatest extent extent one
            could) of Stalin's mind. Since relatively few letters from the collection are written by
            Molotov, most being addressed to him, Molotov is not a character of many words. His
            personality is made visible in the negative, since the only thing we can only discern
            about Molotov is Stalin's manner of writing to him and addressing him as a deputy,
            comrade, and lieutenant. I would dare say, not as a researcher but as a human, that
            Stalin probably felt that Molotov was his friend. However, as with most high-placed
            people in Stalin's USSR, Molotov later saw his fortunes take a turn for the worse. It
            wasn't until 1949, four years after the conclusion of the "Great Patriotic War," that
            Molotov fell out of favor with Stalin and was replaced by the prosecutor Vyshinsky. In
            1953, after the death of Stalin, Molotov was reinstated as Foreign Minister for a time.
            However, his determined opposition to Nikita Khrushchev's "Thaw" put him in a
            politically precarious position. He called Khrushchev a "right-wing deviationist." Huh.
            He was later sacked.</p>
