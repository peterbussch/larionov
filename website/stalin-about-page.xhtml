        <h2>Joseph Stalin</h2>
        <img src="Joseph-Stalin-1950.jpg" alt="Joseph Stalin" />
        <p>This project was created by Hunter Cassoza and Peter Busscher for Computational Methods
            in the Humanities at the University of Pittsburgh. This work explores the correspondence
            between Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov between 1925 and 1936. In these letters we
            see a leader who is in many ways empowered, but still ascending his own personal quest
            to power. In these letters we see a wide-ranging subject matter of industrial policy,
            specific articles in <em>Komsomolskaya Pravda</em> and international relations, among
            other things.</p>
        <h2>Vyacheslav Molotov</h2>
        <img src="Vyacheslav-Molotov.jpg" alt="Vyacheslav Molotov" />
        <p>Compared to Joseph Stalin, who needs little introduction, Vyacheslav Molotov may be less
            familiar to a general audience. To students of Soviet history and World War II, Molotov
            is a silent giant. While he was capable of great outbursts of emotion, Molotov was a
            quite, calculating man. He was an extraordinarily effective deputy, and an effective
            negotiator. Famously, he concluded the Pact with Hitler's Germany which has became known
            to history as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Although, within these letters, Molotov was
            not yet the influential Foreign Affairs Minister that he would later become, he is still
            a privileged confidant who learns the inner workings (to the greatest extent extent one
            <em>could</em>) of Stalin's mind. Since relatively few letters from the collection
            are written by Molotov, most being addressed to him, Molotov is not a character of many
            words. His personality is made visible in the negative, since the only thing we can only
            discern about Molotov is Stalin's manner of writing to him and addressing him as a
            deputy, comrade, and lieutenant. I would dare say, not as a researcher but as a human,
            that Stalin probably felt that Molotov was his friend. However, as with most high-placed
            people in Stalin's USSR, Molotov later saw his fortunes take a turn for the worse. It
            wasn't until 1949, four years after the conclusion of the "Great Patriotic War," that
            Molotov fell out of favor with Stalin and was replaced by the prosecutor Vyshinsky. In
            1953, after the death of Stalin, Molotov was reinstated as Foreign Minister for a time.
            However, his determined opposition to Nikita Khrushchev's "Thaw" put him in a
            politically precarious position. He called Khrushchev a "right-wing deviationist." Huh.
            He was later sacked.</p>
        <h3>Falling out of Favor: Trotsky and Bukharin in the Stalin-Molotov Letters</h3>
        <p> In the correspondence between Stalin and Molotov, we see how specific figures in the
            life of the Communist party fall out of favor through a series of interactions. We can
            assign variables to these characters, and enable analysis through modern computer
            methods. Under the Conclusion tab, we will share the findings of our research, but this
            space is a good one for sharing the approach to Regular Expression auto-tagging which
            enabled our project's markup. Since the 86 letters are too much for one (lazy) college
            student to carefully markup one-by-one in the original, terse Russian, our project
            relied on constantly improving the quality of the markup through a variety of
            autotagging methods. For example: using the expression 'Стали[ЁёА-я]*' to find all case
            derivations of the Stalin name in Russian. For those that are unfamiliar with the
            Russian linguistic structure, it is essential to note that Russian has a case system
            which renders its language very amenable to Regex queries. The high level of success we
            had in this project has encouraged me to pursue this method further with other
            Russian-language work.</p>

        <p> A special thank you to Dr. James Pickett and Dr. David Birnbaum for their help on this
            project. We have certainly come a long way in the past months. It wouldn't have been
            possible without them! </p>
