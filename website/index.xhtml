            <em>Stalin's Letters</em> is a collaborative effort which combines the worlds of
            humanities and computer science. The result of our teamwork is a worthwhile research
            project and website which explores the correspondence between Joseph Stalin and
            Vyacheslav Molotov between 1925 and 1936. In these letters we see a leader with plenty
            of administrative license, but one still ascending his own personal quest to power.
            Within the text of these letters we see a wide-ranging subject matter of industrial
            policy, specific articles in Komsomolskaya Pravda and international relations. This
            research project digs into the Stalin-Molotov corpus for their primary source value.
            Through close and "distant" readings of the texts, a window is opened to the realities
            of Soviet administration. The character of Stalin as tyrannical mass-murderer is known
            to many, and for good reason. However, the job of the historian is to unearth
            information which may lead to a more complex portrait. Within these letters, Stalin
            plays the various roles of literary critic, construction manager, and commentator on
            international affairs. Our use of digital methods played an essential role in this
            research.</p>
